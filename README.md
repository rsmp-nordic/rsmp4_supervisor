# RSMP 4 Supervisor
This is part of an experiment to see how RSMP 4 could be build on top of MQTT.

This Phoenix web app acts as an RSMP supervisor.

## Running
The MQTT broker and the MQTT device (rsmp_mqtt) should be running (or you can start them afterwards)-

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.


# CLI
From iex (Interactive Elixir) you can use the RSMP.Supervisor module to interact with RSMP MQTT clients. If you have a client running, you should see commands send to the client:

```sh
%> iex -S mix
Erlang/OTP 25 [erts-13.2.2.3] [source] [64-bit] [smp:8:8] [ds:8:8:10] [async-threads:1]
